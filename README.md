google Fonts need API to add to project bibliophile; name of site will be called cafe conversations and will provide users to link to my vast list of researched literary classics and more in short stories and books by a few modern authors to read just by linking for absolutely free and post feedback and comments and write stories or essays of their own for others to comment on as well as critique books they've read and share any additional suggestions or links to free books that they suggest. It is a sharing community with the ability for writers' to create a community for themselves.
